/**
 * This file serves as a "barrel" for all the step components in this directory.
 * It re-exports all the step components from a single module, which allows for
 * cleaner and more convenient imports in other parts of the application.
 *
 * For example, instead of:
 * import Step1 from './components/steps/Step1DatabaseConfig';
 * import Step2 from './components/steps/Step2SchemaDefinition';
 *
 * You can do:
 * import { Step1DatabaseConfig, Step2SchemaDefinition } from './components/steps';
